/// An extension providing default implementations for tab coordinator management.
///
/// This extension adds convenience methods to types that conform to both `TabCoordinatorType`
/// and `TabCoordinatable`, simplifying common operations like page management and coordinator setup.
extension TabCoordinatorType where Self : TabCoordinatable {
    
    /// Sets the array of pages for the tab coordinator.
    ///
    /// This method replaces the current set of pages with a new array and optionally updates
    /// the current page. It performs cleanup of existing child coordinators before setting up
    /// the new pages.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - values: The array of pages to set. Each page will have its corresponding coordinator
    ///             created and added as a child coordinator.
    ///   - currentPage: The optional current page to set. If provided, this page will become
    ///                  the selected tab. If `nil`, the current page selection remains unchanged.
    ///
    /// - Important: This method removes all existing child coordinators before adding new ones.
    ///              Make sure to call this method when you need to completely replace the tab structure.

    /// This internal method creates child coordinators for each page and configures them
    /// with appropriate tag identifiers. It's used both during initialization and when
    /// updating the page structure.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - value: The array of pages to set up. Each page will have its coordinator created
    ///            via the `coordinator()` method.
    ///   - currentPage: The optional current page to set as selected. If provided, this page
    ///                  will become the active tab.
    ///
    /// - Note: Each child coordinator's `tagId` is set to match its corresponding page's position
    ///         to enable proper coordination between tabs and their coordinators.
