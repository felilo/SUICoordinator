/// A protocol defining the interface for managing and coordinating tab-based navigation.
///
/// Types conforming to `TabCoordinatorType` provide the core functionality for tab-based
/// navigation including page management, selection handling, badge updates, and coordinator
/// retrieval. This protocol works in conjunction with `CoordinatorType` to provide a complete
/// tab navigation solution.
///
/// The protocol supports:
/// - Dynamic page management with add/remove capabilities
/// - Badge notifications for individual tabs
/// - Custom view containers for tab interface customization
/// - Coordination between tabs and their associated child coordinators
///
/// ## Usage
/// Implement this protocol to create custom tab coordinators, or use the provided
/// `TabCoordinator` class which implements this protocol.
///
/// ```swift
/// class MyTabCoordinator: TabCoordinatorType {
///     // Implementation details...
/// }
/// ```
@MainActor
public protocol TabCoordinatorType: ObservableObject {
    
    // ---------------------------------------------------------
    // MARK: Associated Type
    // ---------------------------------------------------------
    
    /// The associated type representing the page used by the tab coordinator.
    ///
    /// This must conform to the `TabPage` protocol to ensure the page has the necessary
    /// properties and behavior for tab navigation, including title, icon, position, and
    /// coordinator creation methods.
    associatedtype Page: TabPage
    
    /// A typealias representing a badge item.
    ///
    /// A badge item is a tuple containing an optional `value` (typically a string representing
    /// a notification count or status) and the associated `page` to which the badge belongs.
    /// The value can be `nil` to indicate no badge should be displayed.
    typealias BadgeItem = (value: String?, page: Page)

    var currentPage: Page { get set }
    
    /// A publisher for setting badge values on specific pages.
    ///
    /// Send badge updates through this subject using a tuple containing the badge value
    /// (or `nil` to remove the badge) and the target page. The tab interface will
    /// automatically update to reflect the new badge state.
    ///
    /// Example usage:
    /// ```swift
    /// setBadge.send(("5", myPage)) // Set badge to "5"
    /// setBadge.send((nil, myPage)) // Remove badge
    /// ```
    var setBadge: PassthroughSubject<(String?, Page), Never> { get set }
    
    /// An array containing all pages managed by the tab coordinator.
    ///
    /// This array represents the complete list of available tabs. Changes to this array
    /// should trigger updates in the tab interface to add, remove, or reorder tabs.
    var pages: [Page] { get set }
    
    /// A closure that provides the custom view container for the tab interface.
    ///
    /// This closure receives the `TabCoordinator` instance and returns a custom view
    /// that implements the tab interface. If not provided, the coordinator will use
    /// the default `TabViewCoordinator`.
    ///
    /// Use this to completely customize the appearance and behavior of your tab interface:
    /// ```swift
    /// viewContainer = { coordinator in
    ///     MyCustomTabView(coordinator: coordinator)
    /// }
    /// ```
